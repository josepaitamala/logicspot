# LogicSpot Test Theme

This is a Magento 2 theme created following the brief for the LogicSpot FE Dev test. The test was actually created to be a stand alone HTML, CSS, and JS, however I was required to make it using Magento 2 to show my knowledge of the platform. I created my theme based on the the Magento blank theme.

# Installation

Simply download the zip file, unzip it and you will be able to see the 'logicspot' folder.
Copy this folder inside your Magento 2 environment so the path looks like this:

app/design/frontend/logicspot

Then in the admin area, go to your Admin > Content > Design > Configuration, click on the store you would like to apply the theme, and apply the theme.

In the front of the website, navigate to any product, and add the product to the basket, then go to the basket page to be able to see the work I have done.

You can test the hover states, the quantity numbers validation, and also the console after clicking the submit button.

# Notes

I did most of the tasks except for adding 'In Stock' label to the products, and 'Old price' into the basket, since I reckon this would be a Back End Dev task to bring the data into the basket, so then I could style it. I didn't want to hardcode them into the basket template since it wouldn't look good. I hope this is ok.
